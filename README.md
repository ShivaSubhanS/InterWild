# Bringing Inputs to Shared Domains for 3D Interacting Hands Recovery in the Wild

## Our new Re:InterHand dataset has been released, which has much more diverse image appearances with more stable 3D GT. Check it out at [here](https://mks0601.github.io/ReInterHand)!

## Introduction
This repo is official **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)** implementation of **[Bringing Inputs to Shared Domains for 3D Interacting Hands Recovery in the Wild (CVPR 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13652)**.

## Demo
1. Prepare `human_model_files` folder following below `Directory` part and place it at `common/utils/human_model_files`.
2. Move to `demo` folder.
3. Download pre-trained InterWild from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zZy3L6zrHJtWMUEJFonqDtRG9XGHabN1/view).
4. Put input images at `images`. **The image should be a cropped image, which contain a single human. For example, using a human detector. We have a hand detection network, so no worry about the hand postiions!**
5. Run `python demo.py --gpu $GPU_ID`
6. Boxes, meshes, MANO parameters, and renderings are saved at `boxes`, `meshes`, `params`, and `renders`, respectively.

## Directory

### Root
The `${ROOT}` is described as below.
```
${ROOT}
|-- data
|-- demo
|-- common
|-- main
|-- output
```
* `data` contains data loading codes and soft links to images and annotations directories.
* `demo` contains the demo code
* `common` contains kernel code. You should put `MANO_RIGHT.pkl` and `MANO_LEFT.pkl` at `common/utils/human_model_files/mano`, where those are available in [here](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/).
* `main` contains high-level codes for training or testing the network.
* `output` contains log, trained models, visualized outputs, and test result.

### Data
You need to follow directory structure of the `data` as below.
```
${ROOT}
|-- data
|   |-- InterHand26M
|   |   |-- annotations
|   |   |   |-- train
|   |   |   |-- test
|   |   |-- images
|   |-- MSCOCO
|   |   |-- annotations
|   |   |   |-- coco_wholebody_train_v1.0.json
|   |   |   |-- coco_wholebody_val_v1.0.json
|   |   |   |-- MSCOCO_train_MANO_NeuralAnnot.json
|   |   |-- images
|   |   |   |-- train2017
|   |   |   |-- val2017
|   |-- HIC
|   |   |-- data
|   |   |   |-- HIC.json
|   |-- ReInterHand
|   |   |-- data
|   |   |   |-- m--*
```
* Download InterHand2.6M [[HOMEPAGE](https://mks0601.github.io/InterHand2.6M/)]. `images` contains images in 5 fps, and `annotations` contains the `H+M` subset.
* Download the whole-body version of MSCOCO [[HOMEPAGE](https://github.com/jin-s13/COCO-WholeBody/)]. `MSCOCO_train_MANO_NeuralAnnot.json` can be downloaded from [[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OuWlMor5f0TZLVSsojz5Mh6Ut93WkcJc/view)].
* Download HIC [[HOMEPAGE](https://files.is.tue.mpg.de/dtzionas/Hand-Object-Capture/)] [[annotations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oqquzJ7DY728M8zQoCYvvuZEBh8L8zkQ/view?usp=share_link)]. You need to download 1) all `Hand-Hand Interaction` sequences (`01.zip`-`14.zip`) and 2) some of `Hand-Object Interaction` seuqneces (`15.zip`-`21.zip`) and 3) MANO fits. Or you can simply run `python download.py` in the `data/HIC` folder.
* Download ReInterHand[[HOMEPAGE](https://mks0601.github.io/ReInterHand/)] at `data/ReInterHand/data`.

### Output
You need to follow the directory structure of the `output` folder as below.
```
${ROOT}
|-- output
|   |-- log
|   |-- model_dump
|   |-- result
|   |-- vis
```
* `log` folder contains training log file.
* `model_dump` folder contains saved checkpoints for each epoch.
* `result` folder contains final estimation files generated in the testing stage.
* `vis` folder contains visualized results.

## Running InterWild
### Start
* Prepare `human_model_files` folder following above `Directory` part and place it at `common/utils/human_model_files`.

### Train
In the `main` folder, run
```bash
python train.py --gpu 0-3
```
to train the network on the GPU 0,1,2,3. `--gpu 0,1,2,3` can be used instead of `--gpu 0-3`. If you want to continue experiment, run use `--continue`. 


### Test
* Checkpoint trained on [IH26M (H+M) + MSCOCO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12temUVaIhrpUqw-zzXArqI6cm5aMfVWa/view?usp=share_link). FYI, all experimental results of the paper is from a checkpoint trained on IH26M (H) + MSCOCO.
* Checkpoint trained on [IH26M (H+M) + MSCOCO + ReInterHand (Mugsy_cameras)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zZy3L6zrHJtWMUEJFonqDtRG9XGHabN1/view?usp=sharing). 
* Checkpoint trained on [IH26M (H+M) + MSCOCO + ReInterHand (Ego_cameras)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ufTH3J95ss95p4eP7kIUweDCv0C320E/view?usp=sharing).
* Place the checkpoint at `output/model_dump'.
* Or if you want to test with our own trained model, place your model at `output/model_dump`.
* For the evaluation on InterHand2.6M dataset, we evaluated all methods in the paper on `human_annot` subset of interHand2.6M using `data/InterHand26M/aid_human_annot_test.txt`.

In the `main` folder, run 
```bash
python test.py --gpu 0-3 --test_epoch 6
```
to test the network on the GPU 0,1,2,3 with `snapshot_6.pth`.  `--gpu 0,1,2,3` can be used instead of `--gpu 0-3`.
